						Dark mode was improved. The signed-in user interface and experience
						were vastly improved upon. You can check out this
						<a href="/home.html" style="color: blue">here</a>. With a new
						<a href="team.html" style="color: blue">team page</a>. Along with
						changes to the scrollbar. New URL!

						<br />
						Thanks to Looserty, we now have dark mode! You can toggle it with
						the moon/sun button or by typing "openly". We experimented with a
						sidebar, but that didn't work, so we now have a more optimal topbar.
						I also added some interactive OAuth concepts that you can try out
						when clicking on "Connect with Meower" in the openly signup page.
						Obviously there's no actualy OAuth and it doesn't create an account
						(yet). Soon we'll actually get a database to store users and posts,
						but the Meower rewrite is kind of taking most of the spotlight so
						that won't be for a while. Openly might take a backseat for myself
						soon though thanks to the CL4 port of Meower, which I'll have to
						make a admin panel as client-side admin panels are no longer
						possible. Anyway enough off-topic ramblings!
