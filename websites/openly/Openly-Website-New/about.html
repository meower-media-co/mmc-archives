				<h1>What this is/isn't</h1>
				<p class="mainbody">
					<b>Is</b>
					This is a website for sharing bits of code you made on the Internet.
					<br />
					<b>Isn't</b>
					This isn't a website where you share private info (passwords, IP
					addresses, etc).
					<br />
					This isn't a website for any content, just for code. Content that is
					off-topic will be removed.
					<br />
					This isn't a website for sharing file data that is inappropiate when
					pasted (like inappropiate picture data which can be pasted and
					renamed, e.g. file.jpg.txt).
					<br />
					<b>Moderation</b><br />
					What's allowed?<br />
					<br />Sharing appropiate snippets of code suitable for under 18s (it's
					fine if the code is 13+) <br />Team scripting <br />Digital
					citizenship (no bullying whatsoever, etc.) <br />Sharing code that
					doesn't contain offensive material <br />Saying positive things in the
					discord. <br />Making safe, legal, unmalicious code. <br />Following
					the guidelines <br />Letting people keep secrets <br />Being cool.
					<br />Linking to safe websites when needed. <br />Forking instead of
					downloading.
				</p>

				<h3><strong>What's not Allowed?</strong></h3>
				<p class="mainbody">
					<br /><br />Sharing inappropiate or illegal content <br />Spam
					messaging <br />Hate against one Opener becuase of race, sex, gender,
					sexual orientation, religion, political opinion, etc. <br />No
					harassing other Openers (Digital Citizenship Matters) <br />Uploading

					author, or Opener by using @mention.

				</p>
				<h3>What's Special?</h3>
				<p class="mainbody">
					Special Coding Language For snippets of code from special coding
					languages (such as code that isn't text-based such as scratch) we have
					special editors for Scratch, Snap, or other coding languages that are
					not text-based, or use special characters.<br />
					<b>Non-Profit</b><br />
					It's FREE! Everyone can have fun, and share with everyone!<br />
					<b>No ads!</b><br />
					We think there shouldn't be any distractions in your experience in
					openly. I mean, we don't want any party-poopers right?
