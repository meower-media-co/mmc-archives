# Meower-Web
Meower Search Engine... that doesn't actually search<br>
At the moment, Meower Web is just an index page and nothing else.
## Why?
Meower is all about being safe, so it would be a no-brainer to create a non-tracking search engine.
## What about DuckDuckGo?
If you haven't heard, DuckDuckGo was under fire for tracking you, the literal thing they were against.<br>
Meower Web will be a search engine... soon<br>
when I learn more programming.<br>
